================================================================================
CRITICAL FACTS ESTABLISHED
================================================================================

ARCHITECTURE:
  - 5-layer clean architecture (routes → services → repos → ORM → DB)
  - FastAPI backend + React frontend + PostgreSQL database
  - All business logic in services (routes are thin HTTP layer)
  - All data access via repositories (no direct DB queries in services)
  - All models via SQLAlchemy ORM (no raw SQL)

DATABASE:
  - 7 tables: users, projects, sessions, messages, user_preferences, documents, audit_log
  - UUIDs for all primary keys
  - Proper foreign key constraints with cascade/set null
  - 28 indexes on common queries
  - Alembic for version-controlled migrations

API:
  - 20+ REST endpoints
  - Standard response format: {success, data/error, message}
  - JWT token authentication
  - Request validation with Pydantic schemas
  - Consistent error handling

SERVICES:
  - 7 services: User, Project, Session, Message, Preference, Document, AuditLog
  - All validation in services (not routes)
  - All authorization in services (not routes)
  - All error handling and logging
  - Transaction management (commit/rollback)

AUTHENTICATION:
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (NOT plain text)
  - JWT tokens for stateless authentication
  - Token expiration (24 hours)
  - No session server needed

QUALITY STANDARDS:
  - 80%+ test coverage minimum
  - All errors handled and logged
  - All inputs validated
  - No greedy patterns (everything complete)
  - Type safety: Pydantic + TypeScript
  - No hardcoded values

================================================================================
KEY NUMBERS
================================================================================

Technology Stack: 12 technologies specified
Database Tables: 7
Database Indexes: 28
API Endpoints: 20+
Service Classes: 7
Repository Classes: 7 (one per model)
Implementation Phases: 10
Total Development Hours: 24-35 (6-7 days full-time)
Lines of Plan Documentation: ~2,845
Quality Coverage Requirement: 80%+ tests

================================================================================
WHAT NOT TO DO
================================================================================

❌ Copy code from old Socrates repository (has security flaws)
❌ Skip validation or error handling ("too complex")
❌ Use fake/stub AI responses (implement real Claude API)
❌ Put business logic in routes (use services)
❌ Use raw SQL (use SQLAlchemy ORM only)
❌ Hardcode configuration values (use env/config)
❌ Leave error cases unhandled
❌ Skip tests ("we'll test later")
❌ Make assumptions (verify with Plan documents)
❌ Implement incomplete features ("will do later" = greedy pattern)

================================================================================
GETTING STARTED - NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. READ PHASE 1 CHECKLIST
   Location: Plan/SOCRATES_8_0_BUILD_TODO.md (Section: PHASE 1)
   Content: Step-by-step project setup guide

2. CREATE PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Create Socrates-8.0/ directory
   - Create backend/, frontend/, docs/ subdirectories
   - Initialize git repository

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, etc.
   - Frontend: Node.js 18+, React, TypeScript, Redux, etc.
   - Database: PostgreSQL 14+

4. SET UP DATABASE
   - Create PostgreSQL database named "socrates_8"
   - Initialize Alembic
   - Create .env file with DATABASE_URL and API keys

5. FIRST GIT COMMIT
   After Phase 1 completion:
   git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup with folder structure"

6. MOVE TO PHASE 2
   Phase 2: Create SQLAlchemy models and migrations

================================================================================
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
================================================================================

1. NO GREEDY PATTERNS
   Everything must be implemented completely:
   ✅ Validation complete, not partial
   ✅ Error handling complete, not "will add later"
   ✅ Security complete, not "test only"
   ✅ Tests complete, not "optional"

2. FACTS ONLY
   All code based on Plan documents:
   ✅ No assumptions about requirements
   ✅ No deviations from architecture
   ✅ No "I think this is how it should work"
   ✅ Verify everything with documentation

3. COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS
   Each phase must be fully working:
   ✅ Not "70% done, will finish later"
   ✅ Not "basic version, will enhance"
   ✅ Not "needs testing, will do next week"
   ✅ Phase not complete until everything works

4. TESTING CONTINUOUS
   Don't skip tests:
   ✅ Write tests as you build (not after)
   ✅ Minimum 80% code coverage
   ✅ All tests must pass before phase complete
   ✅ Run: pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

5. GIT COMMITS FREQUENT
   Track progress in version control:
   ✅ Commit after each phase
   ✅ Meaningful commit messages
   ✅ Reference phase number and scope

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA

  ✅ All checklist items done
  ✅ All code follows patterns from Plan documents
  ✅ All tests passing (100%)

Taking time now to:
  ✅ Understand the architecture
  ✅ Read all specifications
  ✅ Follow the patterns exactly
  ✅ Implement everything completely
  ✅ Test continuously

...will result in:
  ✅ Zero technical debt
  ✅ Easy to maintain
  ✅ Easy to scale
  ✅ Professional quality
  ✅ Ready for production

The time investment now saves months of debugging later.
