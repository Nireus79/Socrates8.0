## STARTING PHASE 1 NOW

### Phase 1: Project Setup (2-3 hours)
**Read:** [Plan/SOCRATES_8_0_BUILD_TODO.md - PHASE 1](Plan/SOCRATES_8_0_BUILD_TODO.md)

**Key Tasks:**
1. Create `Socrates-8.0/` directory with backend/, frontend/, docs/ folders
2. Initialize git repository
3. Create backend/requirements.txt with all Python dependencies
4. Create frontend package.json with all Node dependencies
5. Set up Python virtual environment
6. Install all dependencies
7. Create .env file with DATABASE_URL and API keys
8. Create PostgreSQL database
9. Initialize Alembic
10. Make first git commit

**Completion:** When all dependencies are installed and ready

### Phase 2: Database Layer (2-3 hours)
**Read:** [Plan/DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md](Plan/DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md)

**Key Tasks:**
- Create 7 SQLAlchemy models
- Generate Alembic migration
- Apply migration to PostgreSQL
- Test database schema

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### ✅ DO THIS
- ✅ Read all Plan documents before coding
- ✅ Follow the 10-phase checklist exactly
- ✅ Implement everything completely (no greedy patterns)
- ✅ Test as you build (80%+ coverage minimum)
- ✅ Commit after each phase
- ✅ Use only facts from Plan documents
- ✅ Apply design patterns exactly as shown

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS
- ❌ Copy code from old Socrates repository
- ❌ Skip validation or error handling
- ❌ Use fake/stub AI responses
- ❌ Put business logic in routes
- ❌ Use raw SQL (use SQLAlchemy ORM)
- ❌ Hardcode configuration values
- ❌ Skip tests ("we'll test later")
- ❌ Make assumptions

## KEY FACTS

### Architecture (5 Layers)
```
FastAPI Routes (thin HTTP layer)
    ↓
Service Layer (thick business logic)
    ↓
Repository Layer (data access)
    ↓
SQLAlchemy ORM
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

### Database (7 Tables)
- users
- projects
- sessions
- messages (user + assistant)
- user_preferences
- documents
- audit_log (change tracking)

### API (20+ Endpoints)
- 4 Auth endpoints
- 5 Project endpoints
- 6 Session endpoints
- 2 Message endpoints
- 5 Profile/Settings endpoints
- 2 Health endpoints

### Technology Stack
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- Database: PostgreSQL with UUIDs
- Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Redux
- Real-time: socket.io
- Testing: pytest (80%+ coverage)
